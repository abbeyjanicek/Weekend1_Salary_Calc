# Weekend Challenge 1: Salary Calculator: Create an application that records employee salaries and adds salaries up to report monthly costs. 

The application should have an input form that collects _employee first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary_.

A 'Submit' button should collect the form information, store the information to calculate monthly costs, 
append information to the DOM and clear the input fields. Using the stored information, 
calculate monthly costs and append this to the to DOM. If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, 
add a red background color to the total monthly cost.

Create a delete button that removes an employee from the DOM. 

HTML:
In the content div, I need to: 
    DONE: create 5 input boxes: first, last, ID, title, salary
    DONE: create a button: submit
    DONE: create a table that will hold the info from the input boxes

JS/jQuery: 
For the input fields & button, I need to:
    DONE: grab the inputs
    DONE: append the results to the table 
    DONE: clear the inputs
    monthly salary: divide the annual salaries by 12
    total the monthly salaries
    if total > 20000, turn the monthly cost red
    delete button to remove employee

Stretch:
    Alphabetize table entries
